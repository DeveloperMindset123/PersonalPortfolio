//update 1: import the neccessary components we will need for this section

//update 2: generates the nicely looking dark background we have based on the following tag on line 8: section className="relative w-full h-screen mx-auto">

//update 3: create a div component inside the section component with various tailwindcss based classnames

/* important classNames to remember
* w-{number}: to set an element to a fixed width
* h-{number}: to set an element to a fixed height
* mt-5: Add margin to a single side
** Control the margin on one side of an element using the `m{t|r|b|l}--{size}, mt stands for "margin-top", mr stands for "margin-right", mb stands for "margin-bottom" and ml stands for "margin-left"

* flex-col: to position flex items vertically
* flex-row : use 'flex-row' to position flex items horizontally in the same direction as text.
* bg: stands for background and we have subcomponents for specifying size, origin, color, padding etc.
